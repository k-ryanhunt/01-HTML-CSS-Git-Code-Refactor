# 01-HTML-CSS-Git-Code-Refactor

## What is the 01-HTML-CSS-Git-Code-Refactor project about?

For this project, I was tasked with refactoring a HTML file and CSS stylesheet.  When we refactor code, it often makes the code easier to maintain and makes it more efficient.  Having code that is hard to read can make the debugging process more difficult than it needs to be and decreases its readability to other coders who may come across your work and need to make changes.  Refactoring does not change the appearance or functionality of the website but instead only improves the internal structure of the code. 

## How did I do it?

When I first started on this project, my first plan of attack was to just clean up the CSS so that I was working with less code. Here is a step-by-step of how I cleaned up my code.
1. Consolidated of the CSS elements, tags, classes that had the same styling so that my code wasn't repeating itself.
2. Ordered my CSS so that it reads from left to right, then top to bottom corresponding to the written HTML.
3. After consolidating the CSS, I started cleaning up my HTML.  I went through and determined which elements were contributing to my HTML in an efficient manner and which ones weren't.  Anything that wasn't referenced in the CSS stylesheet or affecting my website's behavior, I got rid of it.  It is code/text that isn't productive or efficient.
4. Once I went through and deleted any unneccesary tags, I went back to my CSS.  I then consolidated the classes that had the exact same styling and made them into one class instead of stacking them and taking up unneccessary space.

## What functionality should the website still have?

The website should still have the following criteria after refactor:
1. The navigation bar should jump to the corresponding section on the page when clicked.
2. The benefits should be on the right-hand side.
3. Alt tags should be added to all of the images for accessibility.
