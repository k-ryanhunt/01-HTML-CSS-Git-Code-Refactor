# 01-HTML-CSS-Git-Code-Refractor

## What is the 01-HTML-CSS-Git-Code-Refractor project about?

For this project, I was tasked with refactoring a HTML file and CSS stylesheet.  When we refactor code, it often makes the code easier to maintain and makes it more efficient.  Having code that is hard to read can make the debugging process more difficult than it needs to be and decreases its readability to other coders who may come across your work and need to make changes.  Refactoring does not change the appearance or functionality of the website but instead only improves the internal structure of the code. 

## How did I get started?

When I first started on this project, my first plan of attack was to just clean up the CSS so that I was working with less code.
